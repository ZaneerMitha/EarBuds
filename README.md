# üí¨ EarBuds Overview

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is it?

EarBuds is a musical social media platform for discovering and rating music albums. Users are able to rate their favorite (or least favorite) albums, leave reviews on records, and explore their friends' tastes in music. Additionally, EarBuds provides users with album recommendations on their home pages with the aim of helping them discover new music.

As an avid music-listener, I love to share my opinions on albums. I feel that albums are works of art, and discussing them sparks a truly unique discourse. I aspired to create a space dedicated to exploring new albums and learning about what people think of them, thus EarBuds was born.

## üíª Technologies

EarBuds implements JavaScript and React to facilitate user-interaction, letting users view profiles and leave reviews. It employs HTML for structure and CSS for colors, styling, and intuitive navigation through 5 user-friendly pages. It utilizes Bootstrap for responsive layout and MongoDB to pull album data from libraries and allow users to create EarBuds accounts. Lastly, it incorporates Redux to handle state management across the application.

TL;DR:

- JavaScript
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB
- Redux

# Running EarBuds on your local machine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
